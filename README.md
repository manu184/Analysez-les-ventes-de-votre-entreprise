# Project 4: Analyze your company's sales

Project done as part of my data analyst studies.

## Situtation
In this project, we are a new data analyst freshly hired since one week for a bookstore chain. The IT department gives us a view to access the sales database.

## Process
First, I started by cleaning and checking the data in the file which returns csv files ready for analysis.

Then I performed a global analysis of the data, in the first part of the Data_Analysis.ipynb file, trying to learn as much as possible about the customers, their habits and our products.

Finally, I answered some questions that were asked to me, especially about the correlations of the data.

## Data used and sources
In this project we will use :

[customers.csv] -- List of customers, including customer id, date of birth and gender
[products.csv] -- List of products, including product id, price and category
[transactions.csv] -- List of sales, including product id, date, session id (cart) and finally customer id
All these data are made by my training structure for this project
